In my notebook I explain my entire regression analysis process. I began with observing the data types in different columns, used several techniques to transform/clean the data, deal with duplicates, and transform one column to categorical dummies. After getting the data-set I wanted, I looked at all the scatter plot's and further removed any columns that I did not observe a linear relationship with price. Following this process I checked for normality with histograms. Following this I decided to use logorithmic transformation of the normalized data, used some min-max scaling, and ran my OLS Regression. Following the regression I did a forward stepwise selection of parameters to include in my model. Finally I used a K-fold cross validation technique to validate my model.
